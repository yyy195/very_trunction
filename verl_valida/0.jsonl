The diagonal of the square is also equal to the diameter of the circle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of each side of the square. Let's denote the length of each side of the square as \\(s\\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal of the square is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of length 6 inches and 6 inches. Therefore, we have \\(s^2 + s^2 = 12^2\\).

In the right triangle formed by the line segment from the vertex of the 45-degree angle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse, the angle opposite the 45-degree angle is 90 degrees.\n\nGiven:\n- The angle at the vertex of the 45-degree angle is 45 degrees.\n- The angle at the vertex of the 30-degree angle is 30 degrees.\n- The hypotenuse of the right triangle is 8 units.\n\nLet's denote the length of the line segment from the vertex of the 45-degree angle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse as \\(y\\). Since the angle at the vertex of the 45-degree angle is 45 degrees, the line segment from the vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse, which is \\(y = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) units.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (\\(h\\)) of the right triangle:\n\\[h^2 = 4^2 + 30^2\\]\n\\[h^2 = 16 + 900\\]\n\\[h^2 = 916\\]\n\\[h = \\sqrt{916}\\]\n\\[h = 2\\sqrt{229}\\]\n\nSince the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 8 units, we have:\n\\[8^2 = 2\\sqrt{229}\\]\n\\[64 = 2\\sqrt{229}\\]\n\\[\\sqrt{229} = 32\\]\n\\[229 = 32^2\\]\n\\[229 = 1024\\]\n\nThis is incorrect, indicating a mistake in our approach. Let's correct it:\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the 30-degree angle in the right triangle is opposite the 45-degree angle, which means the 30-degree angle is half the 45-degree angle. Therefore, the 30-degree angle is 15 degrees.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find \\(x\\):\n", "gts": "4 \\sqrt { 2 }", "score": 0.0, "step": 0, "reward": 0.0}
